## Work Description

For this Project we utilised Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars and mySQL to create a functional and adaptable website that utilises back end functionality and database to retain user security and information. We used Tailwind for page layout and styling. For the project we split the jobs into 5 parts and all worked on one each for the final website.

Models for all website data
User profile homepage
Workshop homepage
Technician homepage
Initial homepage for login / signup
A major challenge we faced during this project included a deciding a final structure for our project, this influenced our models and how our pages would be set up. We initially over complicated our idea but by discussing ideas and goals as a group we simplified our end product and came up with a workable view of how the project should take shape. At different points we all had our own minor issues but as a group or with guidance we were able to eliminate any potential lager issues.

Our major success with this project has been working as a team and all doing our part and helping each other when one of us had a problem. Our communication was good and if something required attention everyone was quick to address the problem in a orderly manner and inform everyone else of the change and the problem it addresses.
